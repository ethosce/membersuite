# MemberSuite PHP API

This is a modern alternative to https://github.com/membersuite/sdk-php

Why
---
MemberSuite's PHP SDK was an outsourced project to smartData and is [not supported](http://community.membersuite.com/membersuite/topics/does-the-php-implementation-of-the-sdk-work#reply_18833815).

This API client uses the built in SimpleXML, OpenSSL, and SoapClient extensions instead of raw requests, outdated libraries, and other bad things.

Install
---
`composer require ethosce/membersuite`

Usage
---
See https://github.com/ethosce/membersuite/blob/master/example.php
